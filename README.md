💡 Project Title:
Analyzing the Global Impact of COVID-19 Using SQL and Power BI

🔍 Problem Statement:
During the global COVID-19 pandemic, governments and organizations faced challenges in monitoring the spread, deaths, and recovery trends due to scattered data sources. A centralized, visual dashboard was essential for quick insights and decision-making.

🛠️ My Solution:
Using SQL and Power BI, I developed an interactive dashboard that provides a comprehensive global analysis of COVID-19. This solution cleans, transforms, and visualizes key metrics from a reliable dataset.

📊 Key Features of the Dashboard:
Total Confirmed Cases: 264M

Total Recovered: 151M

New Cases This Week: 4M

Total Deaths: 87K

Visuals include:

Confirmed and recovered cases by country

Deaths by WHO region

Week-over-week changes

Pie charts for active and new cases distribution

🌐 Tech Stack:
SQL – For data extraction and transformation

Power BI – For creating dynamic, interactive visualizations

Kaggle Dataset – As the primary data source

🚀 Why This Matters:
This project demonstrates my ability to work with real-world data, perform meaningful analysis, and present it using BI tools for better decision-making. It reflects my learning and growth as a Data Analyst during the 3MTT program.
